# quarto-pres-template

This repository is a template. It contains all the necessary files for creating a Quarto presentation that published using Github Pages.

## General Guidelines

- This template should also have a "docs" folder after the first time you render "index.qmd"
- "index.html" is the rendered versions of "index.qmd" and will be output into "docs", along other various files, every time you render your presentation.

## Using This Template Repo

1. Fork the repo to your own Github account. This creates a copy of it that yours. This step is necessary because the presentation will be published using the account that houses it on Github, and before forking the repo is in @ReedMerrill, not your account. :grinning:
