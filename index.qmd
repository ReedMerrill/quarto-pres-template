# Slide 1

This is a blank Quarto Markdown file. You can write markdown code and regular text here, just like in an R Markdown file. Above is what's called the YAML frontmatter (between the "---"s). It is all the code that is required for this presentation to render. You can add other fields, after which it could look something like this:

```
---
title: "Sweet Reveal.js Presentation"
subtitle: "Made using Quarto Markdown"
author: "Your name here"
---
```

... and so on.

# Slide 2

You'll notice I'm declaring slides using the "#", just like how you would write a section header in an R Markdown file. In a Reveal.js presentation, these serve as slide titles and also demarcate the slides.

For more, you can refer to the awesome guide published by Quarto here: [https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/). 

To begin drafting your own presentation, delete everything in this file below the second "---" at the top.
